# Advent of Code 2023 - Solutions in Gleam
Welcome to my collection of solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/), implemented in Gleam! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

About
Advent of Code is an annual coding event featuring daily programming puzzles from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles cover a wide range of topics such as algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

This repository contains my personal solutions to the challenges, written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), a type-safe and functional programming language for building scalable systems.

Structure

All chalenges are contained in the src folder, and the inputs files in the 'inputs' folder

How to Run
To run any solution, you'll need to have Gleam installed on your machine. Follow the instructions on the official Gleam website to set it up.

Once Gleam is installed, you can simply run

```bash
gleam run -m <name_of_file>
```
